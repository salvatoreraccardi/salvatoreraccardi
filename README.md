# âš¡ About Me
Ciao! My name is Salvatore and I'm a Junior Hardware Engineer.
I develop experimental designs for IoT applications(smart devices, devkit, and more).

ðŸ”¸ I do consulting and development for IoT projects.  

Fun fact: When I was 7 years old, I made my first circuit(A flashlight with a few LEDs and a switch).

## ðŸ§ª My Projects

- [OBJEX Link](https://github.com/salvatoreraccardi/OBJEX_LINK): A modular IoT board, for rapid prototyping and developing research. 
- [OBJEX EHDK](https://github.com/salvatoreraccardi/Energy-Harvesting-DevKit): Energy harvesting DevKit. 
- [Nordic-PPK2-USB_C-Adapter](https://github.com/salvatoreraccardi/Nordic-PPK2-USB_C-Adapter): For measuring the current drawn by a device/board.
- [Smart DoorWindow sensor](https://github.com/salvatoreraccardi/Smart-DoorWindow-sensor): Open source Smart door/window sensor. ESP32-C3 based with a custom power latch to obtain a deep sleep mode current of (30-60nA).
