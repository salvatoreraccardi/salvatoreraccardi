# âš¡ About Me
Ciao! My name is Salvatore(23y/o Italian) and I'm a PCB Designer and a Computer Engineering student.
I develop experimental designs for IoT applications(smart devices, devkit, and more).

ðŸ”¸ I do consulting and development for IoT projects.  

Fun fact: When I was 7 years old, I made my first circuit(A flashlight with a few LEDs and a switch).

## ðŸ§ª My Projects
